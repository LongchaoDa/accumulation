# Machine Learning accumulation

## Challenges

### OOD problems 
OOD problems refer to "Out-of-Distribution" problems. It is related to the model's Robustness and Reliability.  
`closed-world assumption`:Deep neural networks assume test data distribution is similar to the training data distribution.  
`OOD problem`: When the above assumption is not holding true, it will be taken as "Out-of-Distribution", leading bad model performance.  
Types of Generalizations:
In-Distribution Generalization, Out-of-Distribution Generalization
